        <h2>Class Projects</h2>

<p>Various programming projects done while working on a Masters degree in Computer Science. </p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/755-Warehouse">Widget Warehouse</a> (Java)</h3>

<p>Given requirements: Implement Stack and Queue classes in Java using a linked list. The built-in Stack, Queue, and LinkedList library classes cannot be used. Implement an Inventory class that parses an input file of incoming shipments and outgoing orders. While the file is being read, place shipments on the stack and orders on the queue. Fill orders as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Also used JUnit to test basic functionality of the program; not part of the assignment.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/620-RSA">RSA Encryption</a> (Java)</h3>

<p>GUI to simulate RSA encryption. This program encrypts text letter by letter using the ASCII value. Due to possible integer overflow, this program only accepts primes below 100.</p>

<h3>Parallel Programs (C++)</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/450-Friendship">friendship graph</a> uses openMP to find which person in the graph has the most friends.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/450-Gadget">gadget factory</a> uses pthreads and mutexes to simulate a producer consumer problem. Producers create red, white, or blue parts. Consumers build one gadget using one of each part.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/285-Password">Password Cracker</a> (C++)</h3>

<p>Given requirements: Use provided code for permutations to create a password cracker. Must accept a password length via command line.</p>

<p>The password consists of numbers and there is no repetition. Test all possible passwords with pass.o until the correct password is found.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/LWSimpkins/165-Single">"Single"</a> (Java)</h3>

<p>Given requirements: Implement the Card, Deck, Player, and Game classes. Implement a GUI, create computer opponents, and include the rules of the game.</p>

<p>My completed game can have 2-10 computer opponents, which have a basic AI to play legal cards from their hands. The computer players always call "singular" when they have one card left.</p>

<p>The players cards are not click-able if it's not their turn. The player must remember to click the "single" button if they only have one card left in their hand. Otherwise, there is a chance the computer opponents will call them on it, and a card will be added to the players hand.</p>

<p>If the round completes and no one has over 500 points, there is an option to continue to additional rounds until one player reaches 500 points.</p>
